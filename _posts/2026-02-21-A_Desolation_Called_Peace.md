Teixcaalan, when we left off, put down a civil war by the convenient truth of an alien invasion that threatens the empire. Mahit, again finds herself in the middle of the politics; first encounters this time. Fresh from the coup attempt and dramatic show thereafter, she is stuck between a rock - politics of Lsel - and a hard place - the freaking aliens. Fortunately with Yskandr somewhere.

We also see Seagrass, as a perspective character herself. Also with Nine Hibiscus, a new character to the series, giving a perspective within the political machinations of the empires military arms. And Eight Antidote with his innocent, yet very thoughtful childish charm. With their own motives and intentions. Arkady has done another phenomenal job especially with the diversity of perspective in ADCP vs. AMCE enabling, again, an intertwined story, but this time with transparency from the beginning. More of a thriller than a mystery this one.

The story is once again inviting and a bit anxiety inducing with the light touch that Arkady does so well. The pacing is much more in line with the mood of this book and kept me reading at a quicker pace. The universe is expanded for us with the traveling each character does, showing the inner bits of Teixcaalan, the thoughts of its people, and the culture which is of course ever present.

A beautiful series.
